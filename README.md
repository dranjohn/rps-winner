# Rock, Paper, Scissors against an AI
This is a small project trying to win against an RPS AI.
The exact goal and the thought process are documented in the notes.md.
The source code that is doing the winning is inside the src folder,
and is written in python.

The code has been used/tested on python 3.9.6 64-bit.
